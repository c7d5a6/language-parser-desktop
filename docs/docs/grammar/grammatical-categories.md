# Grammatical Categories

A [grammatical category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_category) is a linguistic feature that expresses
meaning through grammatical structures, such as tense, number, or gender. In the `Grammatical Categories` tab, youâ€™ll
find two columns:

- CATEGORIES: Add and manage categories using the `[ + ]` button. Categories appear gray if they have no values and
  white if they do.
- VALUES: Add and manage values for the selected category using the `[ + ]` button.

Save and delete buttons are located in a pane to the right of each column and apply to the selected item. Items can only
be deleted if they are not connected to other configurations.

Categories can be enabled per language for each enabled class separately. The values of each category can also be
enabled per language, allowing selective use. Grammatical categories and their values are used in declensions and word
descriptions. Additionally, values' evolution can be configured for each word class and category.
