# Word Classes

A [word class, or part of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech), categorizes words by their roles in a
sentence, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Word classes shape the structure and meaning of a language. In
the `Word Classes` tab, youâ€™ll find a column listing all usable classes.

- Use `[ + ]` to create a class.
- Select a class to edit or delete it. Classes cannot be deleted if they are used in a language configuration or
  assigned to a word.

Word classes can be enabled per language, allowing selective use. They are used in declensions and word descriptions.
