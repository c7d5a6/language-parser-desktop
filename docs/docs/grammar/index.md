# Grammar

The Grammar section defines the structural elements of your constructed languages. It includes two tabs:

- [Word Classes](./word-classes.md): Manage parts of speech like nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
- [Grammatical Categories](./grammatical-categories.md): Define grammatical features like tense, number, and gender,
  along with their values.
