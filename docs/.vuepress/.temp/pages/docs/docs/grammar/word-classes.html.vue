<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">word class, or part of speech</a>, categorizes words by their roles in a
sentence, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Word classes shape the structure and meaning of a language. In
the <code v-pre>Word Classes</code> tab, youâ€™ll find a column listing all usable classes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code v-pre>[ + ]</code> to create a class.</li>
<li>Select a class to edit or delete it. Classes cannot be deleted if they are used in a language configuration or
assigned to a word.</li>
</ul>
<p>Word classes can be enabled per language, allowing selective use. They are used in declensions and word descriptions.</p>
